        <h2>Calendar</h2>
        <p>February 2019 | Vanderbilt University</p>
        <p class="projectIntro">A calendar storing a collection of reminders in
            the chronological order.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Enable users to add, delete, and search for a certain reminder.</li>
            <li>Examined three different implementations in C++: static
                arrays, dynamic arrays, and linked lists.</li>
            <li>Tested the program with 20+ trial cases to ensure its reliability.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Guitar Simulator</h2>
        <p>March 2019 | Vanderbilt University</p>
        <p class="projectIntro">A program turning text files into sound files.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designed a program that read a text file with information on
                what notes were to be generated and when they were to be generated,
                and from that generated a sound file.</li>
            <li>Experimented text message storing with both a queue ADT and a stack
                ADT in C++ and measured the relative performance.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Text Twist</h2>
        <p>April 2019 | Vanderbilt University</p>
        <p class="projectIntro">A solution generator for the game Text Twist.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Solved the game with the basic principles of trial and error.</li>
            <li>Constructed a tree-like ADT to store a lexicon of all accepted words.</li>
            <li>Implemented the main program that searched for all words in the
                lexicon, of three or more letters, that could be generated
                from the seven given letters.</li>
