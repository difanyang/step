            <p>Oops, wrong one. Here is a picture of me in Tibet. I travelled
              there the summer before college. One of the most beautiful places 
              I have ever been to. Recommend everyone to consider visiting there
              at least once in a lifetime.</p>

            <p>My dear mother, the most precious person on earth.</p>

            <p>I was born in September, a Virgo.</p>

            <p>I love museums and have seriously considered working in one.</p>

            <p>I have also recently picked up baking due to the pandemic ðŸ˜‚ .</p>

            <p>Before my college, I also went to University of California,
              Berkeley for summer school and met some great people.</p>

            <p>Now I am a rising junior at Vanderbilt University. One of my
              best memory at Vanderbilt was singing in the University Concert
              Choir.</p>

            <p>I also went on a volunteer trip called Alternative Winter Break
              during my first winter break and built this cool small bridge 
              with my teammates. It was great fun!</p>
