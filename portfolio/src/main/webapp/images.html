            <p>Welcome to my Memory Palace!</p>
            <p>This is me.</p>

            <p>Oops, wrong one. Here is a picture of me in Tibet. I went there
                the summer before college. One of the most beautiful places I
                have ever been to. Everyone should consider taking a trip there
                at least once in a lifetime.</p>

            <p>This is my most precious person in the world, my dear mother.</p>

            <p>I was born in September, which makes me a Virgo. To be honest,
                this is quite obvious if you have ever seen me collecting my
                milk bottles.</p>

            <p>I love museums and have seriously considered working in one.</p>

            <p>I have also recently picked up baking due to the pandemic ðŸ˜‚ .</p>

            <p>Before my college, I also went to University of California,
                Berkeley for summer school and met some of the best people
                there.</p>

            <p>Now I am a rising junior at Vanderbilt University. One of my
                best memory at Vanderbilt was singing in the University Concert
                Choir.</p>
            <img src="images/vucc.jpeg">

            <p>I also went on a volunteer trip called Alternative Winter Break
                and built this cool small bridge with my teammates.</p>
